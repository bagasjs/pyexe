HOW TO USE?
- Put your python code in "PyExe/src" folder
- Open your cmd go to the "PyExe" folder
- type "pyexe <your_python_file>" NOTE: Do not type the extension .py or else the pyexe will thought that your filename is <filename>.py.py
- The result is in the "result/dist" folder 

Please remember that you still need the python file to run the executable of your python program.

Note : 
I create this program in windows so I don't really know is it working in MacOs or other operating system
